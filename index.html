        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Fueled by curiosity and a drive to solve challenging problems, I specialize in engineering solutions that blend
            technical rigor with real-world impact. My focus on adaptability and growth has allowed me to navigate
            complex industries and deliver meaningful results. As I advance in my career, I’m excited to expand my
            expertise across industries, embracing new opportunities to innovate and learn along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not diving into technical details or leading teams, I love spending time connecting with the
            community, including mentoring younger students. I also enjoy tinkering with personal projects like
            fabricating a PnP machine and exploring entrepreneurial opportunities in medical device design and green energy.
